			<h2>Subtheme: Exploring Speculation & Housing for the Rich</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>What proportion of high-end Boston real estate is owned by absentee investors and how has this amount changed over time?</li>
				<ol type="i">
					<li>Motivation: The <em>Reckoning with Boston’s Towers of Wealth</em> article explains that Boston’s high end real estate market has been increasingly dominated by wealthy absentee owners, which include corporate entities and international investors. I think understanding this scale and growth could allow us to fully grasp its impact on the housing supply and affordability.</li>
				</ol>
				<li>What is the relationship between income levels and the affordability of Boston’s new housing developments?</li>
				<ol type="i">
					<li>The <em>Reckoning with Boston’s Towers of Wealth</em> article states that Boston is facing a housing crisis as luxury high-rises continue to be built at a disproportionate rate compared to affordable housing. This question would provide information as to who is benefiting from Boston’s current housing policies</li>
				</ol>
				<li>How has private equity and institutional investment in housing affected eviction rates and tenant stability in Boston?</li>
				<ol type="i">
					<li><em>When Private Equity Becomes Your Landlord</em> explains how private equity firms will increase rent while reducing maintenance to push out lower-income tenants all in the name of profit. This question’s goal is to understand how this may be impacting tenant stability, specifically in Boston’s rental market.</li>
				</ol>
				<li>How has the concentration of absentee-owned properties affected rent prices in Boston’s neighborhoods?</li>
				<ol type="i">
					<li>In the article <em>When Private Equity Becomes Your Landlord</em>, the authors describe how institutional investors prioritize profit over tenant well-being which leads to rising rents. Ultimately this question will investigate this trend, helping us to understand how speculations affect affordability.</li>

			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>

				<img src="img/Trends in Homeownership and Corporate Ownership Across Boston Neighborhoods.png" alt="Line graphs showing trends in homeownership and corporate ownership rates across Boston neighborhoods over time"/>
				<figcaption>
					These line graphs allow you to compare the rates of both ownership occupancy and corporate ownership over time and in specific neighborhoods within Boston. The idea behind this graph was to reveal how owner-occupancy and corporate ownership rates have changed in Boston’s neighborhoods over time. The first thing that caught my attention was how most of the neighborhoods are relatively close numerically yet downtown stands out as the highest rate in both graphs. Over the last 20 years the occupancy occupancy rate has almost remained constant other than a steady decrease, specifically in downton, going from a rate of 4.320 in 2004 to 3.600 in 2024. This is in contrast to the corporate ownership rate which has been increasing in all neighborhoods. Along with the ownership occupancy rate, the downtown neighborhood has made a drastic increase, going from a rate of 1.560 in 2004 to 4.080 in 2024. Seeing these graphs lead to 2 more questions; Looking at the drastic increase in corporate ownership rate, what was the population over time in Downtown and Dorchester? Seeing that corporate ownership rates are drastically increasing while ownership rates are staying stagnant, how are vacancy rates changing over time?

				<img src="img/Mapping Corporate vs. Owner-Occupied Housing Across Boston Neighborhoods.png" alt="Map comparing corporate ownership and owner-occupied housing rates across Boston neighborhoods" />
				<figcaption>
					In this graph we see another comparison of corporate ownership v.s owner occupancy rates. The idea behind this graph was to help visualize which neighborhoods have the highest corporate ownership concentrations. To do this I created a new variable “Corp_to_Owner Ratio” which is found by dividing the corporate ownership rate by the ownership occupancy rate. Using this ratio a number greater than 1 would mean more corporate-owned housing than owner-occupied in a given neighborhood, while a number less than 1 would mean more owner-occupied housing than corporate-owned. Lastly, according to this formula, 0 would mean very little corporate ownership. Within this graph we see that the corporate to ownership ratio is never 0 showing the steady increase of corporate ownership rate over time. We can also see the neighborhood differences, the southern and southwestern neighborhoods appear to have lower corporate ownership rates. While the neighborhoods in central and north Boston have higher corporate ownership rates, these neighborhoods consist of; Downtown, South Boston Waterfront, etc. Seeing this graph led to one question; What is the racial composition and owner-occupancy rates?

				<img src="img/Corporate Ownership v. Vacany Rates Across Boston Neighborhoods.png" alt="Scatterplot depicting relationship between corporate ownership and vacancy rates in Boston neighborhoods" />
				<figcaption>
					Here is a scatterplot of the Corporate Ownership and Vacancy Rates shown across different neighborhoods in Boston. Visualizing the relationship between corporate ownership rate (x-axis) and vacant units (y-axis). The idea behind this graph was to investigate whether higher corporate ownership correlates with higher vacancy rates. There is a slight positive correlation which suggests that corporate-owned areas tend to have higher vacancy rates. Which was explained in the article When Private Equity Becomes Your Landlord which explains how private equity firms will increase rent while reducing maintenance to push out lower-income tenants all in the name of profit, thus increasing the vacancy rates. Seeing this graph lead to a couple more questions 2 more questions; (1) Which areas in Boston have the highest clusters of high vacancy rates? (2) How has vacancy and corporate ownership rates changed over time?

				<img src="img/Corporate Ownership v. Housing Affordability Across Boston Neighborhoods.png" alt="Scatterplot showing relationship between corporate ownership rates and housing affordability in Boston neighborhoods" />
				<figcaption>
					This graph is a scatter plot being used to analyze the relationship between corporate ownership rate and occupied housing units across Boston neighborhoods. The goal of this plot is to assess whether neighborhoods with more corporate ownership have fewer occupied housing units, which would help indicate speculative property holding or house market inefficiency. I added a trend line which revealed a strong negative correlation which suggests that higher corporate ownership is linked to fewer occupied units. This may be indicating speculative property holding or high vacancy rates. This pattern indicates that corporate-owned properties are more likely to remain vacant. One notable outlier is Dorchester which has significantly more occupied units despite its corporate ownership rates. This outlier suggests that some neighborhoods may have different dynamics which drive occupancy.

				<img src="img/Trends in Housing Vacancy Rates Across Boston Neighborhoods.png" alt="Line plot showing trends in housing vacancy rates across Boston neighborhoods over time" />
				<figcaption>
					This is a line plot used to understand the vacant unit over time for different neighborhoods. To do this I calculated the vacancy rate which was determined by the vacant units divided by the total units. By using the rate the data would be normalized which would provide a more accurate comparison between neighborhoods. A higher vacancy rate means that a greater percentage of the total housing units in a given neighborhood are unoccupied at a given time. This may be a result of a variety of different underlying  economic, social or policy-related factors which will depend on the context. This graph showed the rates for each neighborhood has been consistent across the years with the top 3 highest rated neighborhoods being South Boston Waterfront, Downtown and West End. Some possible causes for these higher vacancy rate neighborhoods may be declining population, which leads to a question: How does has the population in these neighborhoods changed over time?

				<img src="img/Boston Neighborhood Population Trends.png" alt="Line graph depicting population trends in Boston neighborhoods over the past 20 years" />
				<figcaption>
					This graph is to assess the population trends of Boston neighborhoods over the past 20 years. This graph was created in response to an earlier question comparing the ownership occupancy and corporate ownership over time and in specific neighborhoods within Boston. This previous question and graph showed a drastic increase in corporate ownership rates specifically in the neighborhoods of Downtown and Dorchester. Which raises the current question; Has this shift in ownership structure influenced the population trends, or was it a result of a population change? The results of this graph show that Dorchester has the highest population, which is consistent over time. Which makes sense as it is only Boston's largest and most densely populated neighborhood. However Downtown has a lower population than most other neighborhoods, despite experiencing a high increase in corporate ownership. Ultimately this shows the rise in corporate ownership in Downtown is most likely not a result of population growth. Dorchester’s and Downtown’s steady population also suggests that corporate ownership may not be displaying residents at the same rate as other neighborhoods. To further investigate, we would need to look at possible demographic shifts, for example; income levels or racial composition.

				<img src="img/Boston Neighborhood Vacancy Unit Trends.png" alt="Stacked bar graph showing changes in vacancy units across Boston neighborhoods over time" />
				<figcaption>
					This is a stacked bar graph used to display how the number of vacancy units have changed over time. This graph is another created in response to a comparison of ownership occupancy and corporate ownership over time and in specific neighborhoods within Boston. The question and graph showed a drastic increase in corporate ownership rates specifically in the neighborhoods of Downtown and Dorchester, while ownership rates were relatively stagnant, which led to a question: How has the number of vacancy units changed over time? From this graph we see that the two neighborhoods that have a significantly higher number of vacant units are Dorchester and Downtown. These two neighborhoods are also consistently higher than all other neighborhoods. It’s also important to note that the vacancy levels have been stable over time, meaning that despite the increase in corporate ownership the total number of vacant units have not drastically changed. Given that the corporate ownership rate in these areas has increased, but vacancies remain high, this may be caused by corporate entities holding units vacant for speculation rather than renting or selling them. This may also be caused by an issue of supply and demand, where new units are being built but not occupied. This leads us to the question: What is the relationship between Housing Units and Population Growth over time?

				<img src="img/Racial Composition and Homeownership Rates Across Boston Neighborhoods.png" alt="Bar chart comparing racial composition and homeownership rates across Boston neighborhoods" />
				<figcaption>
					This bar chart builds upon the previous analysis of corporate ownership vs. owner-occupancy rates, which wanted to determine which neighborhoods had the highest corporate ownership concentration. This graph leads to the question; How does racial composition relate to owner-occupancy rates? By investigating this question we found that Dorchester and Downton have the largest racial populations across multiple groups. Downtown also stood out as it has one of the highest owner-occupancy rates despite its increasing corporate ownership rate. Dorchester stood out as one of the largest total populations, it also has a lower owner-occupancy rate which may suggest that the corporate ownership might by limiting home ownership opportunities in the area. My last observation was that the racial composition varies significantly across neighborhoods. However, the graphs suggest a possible link between lower owner-occupancy rates and higher corporate ownership in areas with larger minority populations.

				<img src="img/Vacancy Rate Cluster Across Boston Neighborhoods.png" alt="Map visualizing clusters of high vacancy rates across Boston neighborhoods" />
				<figcaption>
					This map visualized which neighborhoods in Boston have the highest clusters of high vacancy rates, which resulted from my initial investigation into the relationship between corporate ownership and vacancy rates. In the previous scatterplot I found that there was a slight positive correlation which suggested that corporate ownership in these neighborhoods tends to have higher vacancy rates. This finding led to the question: Which neighborhoods in Boston experience the highest vacancy rates? Within this map the darker blue areas correspond to higher vacancy rates. One of the key observations from this map has shown that neighborhoods in Central and Northern Boston (Downtown, South Boston Waterfront) have significantly higher vacancy rates when compared to other areas. Another observation was that many of the southern neighborhoods have relatively lower corporate ownership. A possible explanation for this is that firms may want to leave units vacant rather than lowering rents to maintain property values.

				<img src="img/Vacancy and Corporate Ownership Rates Trends.png" alt="Dual axis line graph showing trends of vacancy rates and corporate ownership rates over time" />
				<figcaption>
					This dual axis line graph was used to visualize the trends of vacancy rates and corporate ownership to see if there was a relationship. This was in response to the question, “How has vacancy and corporate ownership rates changed over time?” which was posed upon reflection of the investigation regarding the relationship between corporate ownership and vacancy rates. The blue line, corresponding to corporate ownership rates, shows a dramatic increase particularly after 2016. This suggests that there is a growing trend of corporate ownership, possibly linking to the rising property speculation. This is in contrast to the orange line, corresponding to vacancy rates which have remained stagnant. This line could indicate that these vacancies are concentrated in specific neighborhoods rather than being a city wide issue. These trends could also be the cause of COVID-19 and its effect on housing. As during and after the pandemic this lead to increased foreclosures which created many opportunities for bulk purchases.

				<img src="img/Total Units v. Population Growth.png" alt="Graph comparing total housing units and population growth in Boston over time" />
				<figcaption>
					This graph investigates the question: “What is the relationship between housing units and population growth over time?” which resulted from observing how the vacancy rates have remained stable even though the corporate ownership has been increasing. The previous analysis suggested that corporate entities were possibly holding units vacant for speculation. The purpose of this graph was to investigate if housing availability was keeping up with population growth. In the case that the number of housing unit growth lagged behind population growth, it may indicate a housing supply shortage, which may worsen affordability. Some key observations from this graph was that both the population and housing units have remained constant over time, which would show that there has been no significant increase in housing stock or population growth. However, the fact that these numbers are stagnant may suggest that these corporate acquisitions are not leading to new housing stock. Instead these units may be redistributed ownership of existing properties.

				<img src="img/Racial and Ethnic Population Distribution Across Boston Neighborhoods.png" alt="Graphs showing racial and ethnic population distribution across Boston neighborhoods" />
				<figcaption>
					These graphs provide a breakdown of the racial composition across Boston neighborhoods which offer insights into how much racial demographics intersect with other important trends. An earlier scatterplot showing corporate ownership and vacancy rates displayed a positive correlation between corporate ownership and vacancy rates. This demographic map helps us to identify whether neighborhoods with high corporate ownership and high vacancy rates disproportionately affect certain racial groups. The demographic map shows that Dorchester and Downtown have the largest Black, Hispanic, and AAPI populations. These neighborhoods also have high corporate ownership and high vacancy rates which suggest that corporate landlords may be reducing housing stability in minority neighborhoods.

			<h2>Summary</h2>

			<p>Overall this report has highlighted how corporate ownership, speculative real estate investment, and absentee landlords have been altering Boston’s housing market over the last 20 years. The reshaping of this market has also had significant implications on affordability, homeownership and racial equality. From 2004, corporate acquisitions have drastically increased, particularly after 2016 which has the highest concentration in Downtown and Dorchester. Despite this increase, vacancy rates have remained stable which suggest that corporate landlords may be holding properties for speculation rather than making available for residents. These trends have raised concerns about the inflation of housing costs, reduced homeownership opportunities, and potential displacement of long-term residents.</p>
			<p>Looking at the racial composition analysis has revealed that Black, Hispanic, and AAPI communities are disproportionately affected by these housing trends. The neighborhoods with higher corporate ownership rates tend to also have lower homeownership rates which reinforce the historical barriers to property ownership for communities of color. Boston’s total housing stock and population have also remained stagnant, which points to corporate investment not increasing housing availability, rather shifting control of existing units. Ultimately the findings suggest that corporate speculation may be driving rent increases, limiting homeownership for marginalized groups, and contributing to an affordability crisis. Further research should be conducted to explore the relationship between rent, income labels, corporate ownership and eviction patterns to highlight the impact on Boston’s housing stability.</p>
